Lama Yeshe's master was Lama Tsongkhapa who, he says, was a master of "perfect renunciation." [1][0]

"Places on earth where you can study the pure teachings of Lama Tsongkhapa are very few. That's why it is considered something very precious." [2][1]

_- Lama Zopa Rinpoche_

"In my opinion, having the opportunity to practice the guru yoga of the great holy being, Lama Tsong Khapa, is more fortunate than having the chance to receive and practice other Dharma teachings.

Practicing the guru yoga of the inseperability of your own root guru and Lama Tsong Khapa plants the seed of all happiness from that of this life up to enlightenment." [3][2]

_- Lama Zopa Rinpoche_

"Of the many works of the Tibetan master Tsongkhapa, none compare in terms of popularity and breadth of influence with his Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (Lamrim Chenmo), which has been treasured by practitioners and scholars alike for centuries.

What distinguishes it as one of the principal texts of Mahayana Buddhism is its scope and clarity. It expounds the entire path from the way one should rely on a spiritual teacher, which is the very root, right up to the attainment of Buddhahood, which is the final fruit. The various stages of the path are presented so clearly and systematically that they can be easily understood and are inspiring to put into practice." [4][3]

_- His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama_

"If one keeps even a drop of the nectar of the name of this holy being Lama Tsongkhapa in a devotional heart, it plants the seed of liberation and one receives the fortune to practice and enjoy happiness from this life up to enlightenment." [5][4]

_- Pabongkha Rinpoche_

"If one does the recitation of the Lama Tsongkhapa guru yoga prayer for even one month using one of the visualizations for great or clear or quick wisdom, one will definitely see development of that wisdom. It is proved by experience. There is no doubt that by doing the Lama Tsongkhapa guru yoga practice one can meet Lama Tsongkhapa's teachings from life to life. And furthermore, it gives one the opportunity to be born in the pure realm of Lama Tsongkhapa, Tushita, whenever death happens." [6][5]

_- Pabongkha Rinpoche_
